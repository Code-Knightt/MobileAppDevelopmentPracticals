# Mobile App Development

1. Create an application that designs a layout having a textview. The textview should
display the message “Hello World” in the middle of the screen in red color and the
background color of the layout should be green.

2. Create an application that contains three textviews. The text that is entered in the
first two textviews should be concatenated and it should be displayed in the third
textview.

Enter 2 numbers in first two TextViews and display the result in third TextViews
when the button is clicked. The result of addition should also be displayed in the
Toast message.

Rupees to dollar and vice versa.

fonts, styles and other designs of elements in android application.

6. Study of creating more than one activity: Create a main activity with two TextViews,
and a button. Create second activity with a single TextView. On clicking the button on
the MainActivity, the concatenated text of two TextViews of MainActivity should be
displayed in the TextView of second activity.

7. Define an Activity using Explicit Intent
  - Create a sample application with login module that includes Username and
Password.
  - Perform validation for input Username-Password pair. On successful validation,
navigate to the second activity and display username.
  - On unsuccessful validation, alert user using a Toast message.

8. Define an Activity using Implicit Intent and fragment.
  - Create two fragments and add them on main activity.
  - In the first fragment, include two buttons with the label – 1) Open Browser 2) Call
a Number
  - On clicking the first button, it should open browser in the second fragment.
  - On clicking the second button, a pre-specified number is being called.

9. Design an android application that takes one TextView with the text ‘Select your

TextView and all branch names in strings.xml file. When the user selects any branch,
display it as a Toast message.

hobbies (e.g. cricket, tennis, badminton). When single/multiple checkboxes are
checked, display the selected hobbies in the Toast message.

12. Create an application that designs a layout having a rating bar. Whenever user gives
the rating then a dialog box should appear with a message and button OK. The
message in the dialog box should display the rating out of the total rating. (e.g.: if 1.5
rating is selected then display ‘You have given 1.5 Rating out of 5’). When button OK
